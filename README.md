# SoCal Infra & DevTools Companies ðŸŒ´

A curated list of companies building software infrastructure and/or devtools with an [engineering presence](#engineering-presence-in-socal) in Southern California.

### Why?

To track, curate and share companies building the next-gen of infra and devtools that have an engineering presence in SoCal. 

The other reason is to coordinate and organize local events and meetups with the intent of getting the people behind these companies together to hang out, talk about tech and learn from each other in person.

### Engineering Presence in SoCal?

This simply means that the company has engineers living/working in SoCal that would be interested in participating in local events & meetups.

### Why only SoCal?

Geographic convenience. Similar local groups and communities exist elsewhere in the US (and other countries) including in the SF Bay Area and NYC. We're hoping this can be the local infra & devtools group for SoCal.
